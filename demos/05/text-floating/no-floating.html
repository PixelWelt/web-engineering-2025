    <p class="cheetah">
      Cheetahs are fast-running big cats found primarily in Africa and parts of
      Asia. Known for their incredible speed, they can reach up to 60 miles per
      hour in short bursts. Cheetahs have slender bodies, long legs, and
      distinctive black tear marks on their faces, helping them hunt prey with
      precision in open grasslands.

    <p class="giraffe">
      Giraffes are the tallest land mammals, native to Africa. With their long
      necks and legs, they can reach high tree branches to feed on leaves and
      fruits. Giraffes are known for their distinctive spotted coats, which help
      them blend into the savanna. They are peaceful herbivores and live in
      social groups called towers.

    <p class="monkey">
      Monkeys are intelligent, agile primates found in various regions around
      the world, especially in tropical forests. They are known for their
      dexterous hands, expressive faces, and social behavior. Monkeys are
      omnivores, feeding on fruits, insects, and small animals, and they often
      live in groups that offer protection and cooperation.
